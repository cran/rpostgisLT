\title{Insert relocations from a source table into the table 'zgaqtsn_temp', 
used in as_pgtraj}
\usage{
pgTrajDB2TempT(conn, schema, relocations_table, pgtrajs, animals,
  bursts = NULL, relocations, timestamps, rids, srid, proj4string, note,
  clauses, time_zone)
}
\arguments{
\item{conn}{Connection object created with RPostgreSQL}

\item{schema}{String. Name of the schema that stores or will store 
the pgtraj data model.}

\item{relocations_table}{String. Name of the table that stores the 
relocations, e.g. c("schema","relocations")}

\item{pgtrajs}{String. Name of the pgtraj or name of the field that 
stores the pgtraj names.}

\item{animals}{String. Name of the animal or name of the field that 
stores the animal names.}

\item{bursts}{String. Name of the burst or name of the field that 
stores the burst names.}

\item{relocations}{Vector of string(s). Name of the field(s) that 
contains the relocations in relocations_table. If relocations are 
stored as pairs of (X,Y) or (long, lat) coorindates, the coordinates 
should be separated in two fields and referenced accordingly.}

\item{timestamps}{String. Name of the field in relocations_table 
that contains the timestamps.}

\item{rids}{String. Name of the field in relocations_table that 
contains the numeric IDs of relocations.}

\item{srid}{Numeric. The PostGIS SRID of the CRS of 'relocations'.}

\item{proj4string}{String. The PROJ4 string to be inserted into 
\code{pgtraj} table.}

\item{note}{String. Comment on the pgtraj. The comment is only used 
in the database and not transferred into an ltraj.}

\item{clauses}{String. Additional SQL to modify select query from 
relocations_table}

\item{time_zone}{String. Time zone to be inserted into \code{pgtraj} 
table.}
