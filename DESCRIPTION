Description: Integrates R and the 'PostgreSQL/PostGIS' database 
    system to build and manage animal trajectory (movement) data sets. 
    The package relies on 'ltraj' objects from the R package 'adehabitatLT',
    building the analogous 'pgtraj' data structure in 'PostGIS'. Functions
    allow users to seamlessly transfer between 'ltraj' and 'pgtraj', as
    well as build new 'pgtraj' directly from location data stored in the 
    database.
